Instant Coffee Granules – I have used Nescafe classic instant coffee but you can also use Bru instant coffee (for Indian readers) or any other instant coffee or espresso 
granules you prefer. Feel free to swap in a decaf variety if needed!
Milk – I’ve found that whole milk and 2% milk does a better job of frothing than skim milk, but feel free to use whatever you have on hand. 
You can even make a vegan coffee using your favorite plant-based milk alternative. There’s no need to boil it if it isn’t dairy; simply heat it until it reaches the temperature you desire.
Sugar – I used cane sugar here, but feel free to swap in the sweetener of your choice. Brown sugar or powdered jaggery will give more of a caramelly taste.
Hot Water – Preferably boiling!
Spoon – The first part of this cafe style coffee recipe is beating the coffee with a spoon briskly and vigorously

Jar With Tight-Fitting Lid – Creating a perfect, foamy milk head on your coffee is as easy as heating the milk and shaking the heck out 

of it in a mason jar. If possible, I suggest choosing one with a handle to prevent any discomfort while holding it.
